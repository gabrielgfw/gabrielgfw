### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I've worked with logistics for mostly 5 years, recently I decided to make a big change in my professional career. <br>
Technology has been exactly what I've been looking all those years, without even knowing what I was really looking for. <br>
I'm just at the very beginning of something that I already consider great for my life. <br>
That's why I want to keep learning and reach stages which I've never been before. <br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Dev at Paytrack (Blumenau/SC);
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning better Javascript, Typescript, Angular9, ReactJS, NodeJS; 
- ðŸ’¬ I got some useful knowledge with CSS / Photoshop / Illustrator, which can be useful at certain situations if you need any help;
