### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

As an Integrations Analyst, I've been providing communication with the Paytrack solution among many ERP systems on the market, mostly with financial integrations.<br><br>
Every new project it's an envolving challenge.<br>
Consolidate information, finding the best approach for coding (and actually code), creating properly documentation of the project's scope and what's been delivered for the final client it's part of my day.<br>
<br>
I love coding and even when you spend most of the time actually not coding, when the deal it's done and everything is set up for been writen, every line of code brings a satisfiying feeling that you are doing your best perspective solution of the final result that you are seeking.<br>
