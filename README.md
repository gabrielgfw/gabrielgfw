I've worked with logistics for mostly 5 years, recently I decided to make a big change in my professional career.
Technology has been exactly what I've been looking all those years, without even knowing what I was really looking for.
I'm just at the very beginning of something that I already consider great for my life.
That's why I want to keep learning and reach stages which I've never been before.
