### Hello Fella ðŸ‘‹

I've worked with logistics for mostly 5 years, recently I decided to make a big change in my professional career.
Technology has been exactly what I've been looking all those years, without even knowing what I was really looking for.
I'm just at the very beginning of something that I already consider great for my life.
That's why I want to keep learning and reach stages which I've never been before.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Dev-1 at Senior Sistemas (Blumenau/SC);
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, CSS, HTML, React JS, React Native; 
- ðŸ’¬ I got some useful knowledge with CSS / Photoshop / Illustrator, which can be useful at certain situations if you need any help;
